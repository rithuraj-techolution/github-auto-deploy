# Sylvan: Code Refactering
The Sylvan Code Refactering project aims to provide an AI-based solution for converting Csharp programs into Refactered Csharp code. This involves selecting an appropriate AI system, training it to automate the Refactering process, integrating RLEF.AI for continuous model enhancement, and incorporating domain experts feedback to refine the Csharp-to-Refactered Csharp model.
