we can make this tool project specific - 
    we can have project data stored in the pinecone, pinecone particularly created for that project only
    with that AI can get that data from there and can suggest better results and can understand the flow also.
    this way the tool will be specific to project.

    the function, variable is getting used in some other file
    we may take this in separate delimeter and can give to user in some text file

let user say, what refatoring they want -
    in some manner,  we should get some msg while user raise the PR
    this will help AI understand, what the user needed actually from refatoring pipeline
